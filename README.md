# Spectroscopy and Lasers
A lesson on spectroscopy and lasers - the aim of this lesson is to recap and give context to the recent work we have been doing on energy levels and the photoelectric effect.

##Intro
Spectroscopy and spectrography are terms used to refer to the measurement of radiation intensity as a function of wavelength and are often used to describe experimental spectroscopic methods. Spectral measurement devices are referred to as spectrometers, spectrophotometers, spectrographs or spectral analyzers.
Daily observations of color can be related to spectroscopy. As you have seen Neon and other noble gases have characteristic emission frequencies (colors). Neon lamps use collision of electrons with the gas to excite these emissions. Inks, dyes and paints include chemical compounds selected for their spectral characteristics in order to generate specific colors and hues. A commonly encountered molecular spectrum is that of nitrogen dioxide. Gaseous nitrogen dioxide has a characteristic red absorption feature, and this gives air polluted with nitrogen dioxide a reddish brown color. 

Spectroscopic studies were central to the development of quantum mechanics and included Max Planck's explanation of blackbody radiation, Albert Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect and Niels Bohr's explanation of atomic structure and spectra. 
Spectroscopy is used in physical and analytical chemistry because atoms and molecules have unique spectra. As a result, these spectra can be used to detect, identify and quantify information about the atoms and molecules. Spectroscopy is also used in astronomy and remote sensing on earth. Most research telescopes have spectrographs. The measured spectra are used to determine the chemical composition and physical properties of astronomical objects (such as their temperature and velocity).

## Energy level diagrams:
Energy level diagrams are a means of analyzing the energies electrons can accept and release as they transition from one  accepted orbital to another. These energies differences correspond to the wavelengths of light in the  discreet spectral lines emitted by an atom as it goes through de-excitation or by the wavelengths absorbed in an absorption spectrum.

#Spectroscopy
Open the PhET model, “[Neon Lights and other Discharge Lamps](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/legacy/discharge-lamps)”. Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the discharge tubes model. 
Try clicking on different options, check all of the checkboxes, and get a general feel for how the model works. 
Investigate both the one atom and multiple atoms tabs.
1. In the options (lower right on the model), check the spectrometer and squiggle settings. Notice the
energy diagram on the right of the model, as well as the red arrow labeled “Energy at collision”.
2. Next Click on the “Multiple Atoms” tab on the model. Make sure that the Spectrometer and Squiggle options are checked. For each of the available gases given in the drop down menu on the right side of the model, observe the colors and intensities of light in the visible spectrum emitted by each element.
3. Is this simulation an example of spectral emission or absorption? Explain the difference. Give a practical example of the type that is not used in this sim.
4. Paying particular attention to the energy diagram in the model, describe & draw the process by which the emission of electromagnetic radiation (light) occurs. Can you find out whose atomic model was the first to accurately explain spectral lines?
5. What is a photon? Who was the first person to “discover” this concept?
6. What evidence do you see which suggests that light is emitted in quantized amounts? Explain.
7. What is the Compton Effect and does it play any role with this simulation? Explain what it is and how is does or does not apply. Diagram!!
8. Is it possible for a single electron to collide with the atom of hydrogen which results in more than one photon (particle) of light being emitted? Explain how using your observation from the simulation (use the slow motion option for this!) and by thinking about the question above. Diagram!!
9. Suppose the electrons for a particular gas or material had four different energy states above the ground state. How many different photon energies are possible in this situation? Draw a diagram as part of your solution.
10. Using observations from the simulation, explain the general and physical (equation) relationships between the following:
		a. Frequency and energy
		b. Wavelength and energy
		c. Frequency and wavelength
11. Suppose you are shining light on a metal and you observe electrons being emitted.
		a. What is this phenomena called?
        b. Suppose the metal has a work function of 2 eV.
        		(I). What is the minimum energy, frequency, and wavelength that could stimulate electron emission? What would the speed of those electron be?
                (II). Suppose you observed electrons being emitted at various speeds. The highest speed you observe is 10% of the speed of light. What is the wavelength, frequency, energy, and color of the light incident on the metal?
